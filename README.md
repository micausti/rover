- start with a grid, starting point, and destination
- calculate the shortest path from the starting point to the destination and produce a list of coordinates to represent the path
- once the shortest path is known, that needs to be translated into a list of moves which tell the rover how to get from each position to the next 
- the allowed moves are forward, clockwise, and anticlockwise
- the list of moves is printed to the console
