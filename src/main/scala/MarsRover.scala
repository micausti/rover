  calculate the shortest path from the starting point to the destination and produce a list of coordinates to represent the path
  in the simplest case, the shortest path is the direct path between the start and end point
  for more complex scenarios, there may be obstacles in the way; something like dijkstra's or a* algorithm could be used to determine the shortest path
  once the shortest path is known, that needs to be translated into a list of moves which tell the rover how to get from each position to the next
  the allowed moves are forward, clockwise, and anticlockwise
  the list of moves is printed to the console*/
